                <p class="art-text">When investing so much money in a new gadget, you'll want to make the most of it, thus learning about 5 iPhone 15 features could help you advance. The majority of the features are compatible with iPhone 15 models, however some are only available on iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max models. But all of them will come in handy and support the improvement.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="art-text">Of course, there are a ton of other eye-catching additions, some of which can be seen on older devices as well, because iOS 17 is now accessible. If you haven't already, you should definitely learn how to download and install iOS 17. But with the increased power of the iPhone 15 range and the addition of new hardware features, Apple's flagship gadget really comes into its own. </p> <br>
                <p class="art-text">So let’s take a look at 5 iPhone 15 features you need to know about.</p> <br><br><br>
                <h3>5 iPhone 15 features you need to know about</h3> <br>
                <h5>1. Customize the Action button</h5>
                <br>
                <img src="images/1.png" alt="" class="responsive-img" >
                <p class="credits">(Image: © Future)</p>
                <p class="art-text">Possibly the most intriguing new feature for owners of an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max is the new Action button. It may be assigned to do a variety of tasks and takes the role of the ringer switch found on previous models. The Action button will therefore become active when you long press it, enabling convenient functionality to be accessible at your fingertips.</p> <br>
                <p class="art-text">Check out the <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/ways-to-use-iphone-15-action-button">25 coolest ways to use the iPhone 15 Pro’s Action Button</a> and you’ll see what we mean. As well as being able to make use of one of Apple’s suggestions such as being able to press the button to activate the camera, launch the torch, record a voice memo and more, you can also assign an Accessibility function such as playing a background sound to help you concentrate. Best of all, you can make use of Shortcuts which makes the possibilities endless.</p><br>
                <p class="art-text">To start playing around with the Action button, tap Settings and select Action Button then swipe through the options.</p><br>
                <h5>2. Switch default camera lenses</h5> <br>
                <img src="images/2.png" alt="" class="responsive-img">
                <p class="credits">(Image: © Future)</p> <br>
                <p class="art-text">Again, a feature for iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max owners, the ability to customize the Main camera lens is super-useful. It allows you to set the focal length so you’re not always needing to zoom in when open the Camera app and get ready to take a shot. Instead of using the default 24mm lens – equivalent to 1x zoom – you can instead choose 28mm (1.2x) or 35mm (1.5x). </p> <br>
                <p class="art-text">To do this, go to Settings and select Camera then tap Main Camera and choose a format: either 24mm, 28mm or 35mm. When you then open the Camera app, the lens you chose will be the default. You will still be able to adjust the camera lens within the app.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>3. Limit your battery to 80%</h5> <br>
                <img src="images/3.png" alt="" class="responsive-img">
                <p class="credits">(Image: © Future)</p> <br>
                <p class="art-text">It makes sense that you would want to take good care of your iPhone considering how much money you spent on it. This also includes ensuring that the battery lasts as long as feasible before needing to be changed. You may set an 80% charge limit for any iPhone 15 model. It denotes a lower likelihood of wear and overheating for your lithium-ion battery.</p> <br>
                <p class="art-text">Knowing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-limit-your-iphone-to-80-percent-charge">how to limit your iPhone to 80 percent charge</a> is easy enough. Open the Settings app and select Battery. Then choose Battery Health & Charging and tap Charging Optimization and select 80% Limit.</p><br>
                <h5>4. The addition of video log files</h5><br>
                <img src="images/4.png" alt="" class="responsive-img" >
                <p class="credits">(Image: © Future)</p> <br>
                <p class="art-text">Utilizing a log profile will provide you more freedom and control if you want to make quality videos. By packing more luminance data into a file through compression, it increases the dynamic range that a camera sensor can record. Your films will be more detailed even though you will need to perform post-production work to fix the color and exposure.</p><br>
                <p class="art-text">You can discover more about <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-shoot-video-in-a-log-profile-iphone" target="_blank">how to shoot video in a log profile</a> on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max but to set it up, go to Settings, tap Camera, select Formats and turn on Apple Pro Res. Then tap ProRes Encoding and select Log.</p><br>
                <h5>5. Reverse charging for smaller devices</h5>
                <img src="images/5.png" alt="" class="responsive-img" >
                <p class="credits">(Image: © Apple)</p> <br>
                <p class="art-text">The Lightning Cable is dead. Long live USB-C. But why the love for the latter – a move that was forced upon Apple by the European Union to reduce cable wastage? Well, with a USB-C to USB-C cable, you can use your iPhone 15 to charge your Apple Watch or your AirPods case since USB-C is capable of supporting up to 240W of charging power.</p> <br>
                <p class="art-text">The USB-C port also increases transfer speeds which is great for sending large files between two iPhones, for example (the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max supports USB 3.0 which offers 10Gbps speeds). In all cases, you just need to plug in your devices using the cable. Check out <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-15-usb-c-port-everything-we-know-so-far" target="_blank" >everything you need to know</a> about the iPhone 15 USB-C port to discover more.</p><br>

                <br><br>
                <p class="art-text">In conclusion, the iPhone 15 is a testament to Apple's commitment to innovation and excellence. With its cutting-edge features, it promises to be a game-changer in the world of smartphones. The stunning OLED display, revolutionary AI-powered camera system, lightning-fast A16 chip, 5G connectivity, and enhanced battery life make the iPhone 15 a device that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of tech enthusiasts and everyday users alike. As we embrace the future of mobile technology, the iPhone 15 stands at the forefront, offering a remarkable user experience and setting new standards for what a smartphone can achieve.</p>
